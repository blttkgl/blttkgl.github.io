		  <p>In dual-fuel compression ignition engines, a high-reactivity fuel, such as diesel, is directly injected to the engine cylinder to ignite a mixture of low-reactivity fuel and air. This study targets improving the general understanding on the dual-fuel ignition phenomenon using zero-dimensional homogeneous reactor studies and three-dimensional large eddy simulation together with finite-rate chemistry. Using the large eddy simulation framework, n-dodecane liquid spray is injected into the lean ambient methane–air mixture at 𝜙=0.5. The injection conditions have a close relevance to the Engine Combustion Network Spray A setup. Here, we assess the effect of two different chemical mechanisms on ignition characteristics: a skeletal mechanism with 54 species and 269 reaction steps (Yao mechanism) and a reduced mechanism with 96 species and 993 reaction steps (Polimi mechanism). Altogether three ambient temperatures are considered: 900, 950, and 1000 K. Longer ignition delay time is observed in three-dimensional large eddy simulation spray cases compared to zero-dimensional homogeneous reactors, due to the time needed for fuel mixing in three-dimensional large eddy simulation sprays. Although ignition is advanced with the higher ambient temperature using both chemical mechanisms, the ignition process is faster with the Polimi mechanism compared to the Yao mechanism. The reasons for differences in ignition timing with the two mechanisms are discussed using the zero-dimensional and three-dimensional large eddy simulation data. Finally, heat release modes are compared in three-dimensional large eddy simulation according to low- and high-temperature chemistry in dual-fuel combustion at different ambient temperatures. It is found that Yao mechanism overpredicts the first-stage ignition compared to Polimi mechanism, which leads to the delayed second-stage ignition in Yao cases compared to Polimi cases. However, the differences in dual-fuel ignition for Polimi and Yao mechanisms are relatively smaller at higher ambient temperatures. </p>

		  <p>Here, a finite-rate chemistry large-eddy simulation (LES) solver is utilized to investigate dual-fuel (DF) ignition process of n-dodecane spray injection into a methane–air mixture at engine-relevant ambient temperatures. The investigated configurations correspond to single-fuel (SF) = 0 and DF = 0.5 conditions for a range of temperatures. The simulation setup is a continuation of the work by Kahila et al. (2019, Combustion and Flame) with the baseline SF spray setup corresponding to the Engine Combustion Network (ECN) Spray A configuration. First, ignition is investigated at different ambient temperatures in 0D and 1D studies in order to isolate the effect of chemistry and chemical mechanism selection to ignition delay time (IDT). Second, 3D LES of SF and DF sprays at three different ambient temperatures is carried out. Third, a reaction sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effect of ambient temperature on the most sensitive reactions. The main findings of the paper are as follows: (1) DF ignition characteristics depend on the choice of chemical mechanism, particularly at lower temperatures. (2) Addition of methane to the ambient mixture delays ignition, and this effect is the strongest at lower temperatures. (3) While the inhibiting effect of methane on low- and high-temperature IDT’s is evident, the time difference between these two stages is shown to be only slightly dependent on temperature. (4) Reaction sensitivity analysis indicates that reactions related to methane oxidation are more pronounced at lower temperatures. The provided quantitative results indicate the strong ambient temperature sensitivity of the DF ignition process. </p>

		  <p>In this study, various mixing and evaporation modeling assumptions typically considered for large-eddy simulation (LES) of the well-established Engine Combustion Network (ECN) Spray A are explored. A coupling between LES and Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) is employed to simulate liquid n-dodecane spray injection into hot inert gaseous environment, wherein Lagrangian droplets are introduced from a small cylindrical injection volume while larger length scales within the nozzle diameter are resolved. This LES/LPT approach involves various modeling assumptions concerning the unresolved near-nozzle region, droplet breakup, and LES subgrid scales (SGS) in which their impact on common spray metrics is usually left unexplored despite frequent utilization. Here, multi-parametric analysis is performed on the effects of (i) cylindrical injection volume dimensions, (ii) secondary breakup model, particularly Kelvin–Helmholtz Rayleigh–Taylor (KHRT) against a no-breakup model approach, and (iii) LES SGS models, particularly Smagorinsky and one-equation models against implicit LES. The analysis indicates the following findings: (i) global spray characteristics are sensitive to radial dimension of the cylindrical injection volume, (ii) the no-breakup model approach performs equally well, in terms of spray penetration and mixture formation, compared with KHRT, and (iii) the no-breakup model is generally insensitive to the chosen SGS model for the utilized grid resolution.  </p>

		  <p>The present study is a continuation of the previous work by Kahila et al. (2019), in which a dual-fuel (DF) ignition process was numerically investigated by modeling liquid diesel-surrogate injection into a lean methane-air mixture in engine relevant conditions. Earlier, the injection duration (tinj) of diesel-surrogate exceeded substantially the characteristic autoignition time scale. Here, such a pilot spray ignition problem is studied at a fixed mass flow rate but with a varying tinj. The focus is on understanding the influence of pilot quantity on spray dilution process and low- and high-temperature chemistry. In total, ten cases are computed with multiple diesel pilot quantities by utilizing a newly developed large-eddy simulation/finite-rate chemistry solver. The baseline spray setup corresponds to the Engine Combustion Network (ECN) Spray A configuration, enabling an extensive validation of the present numerical models and providing a reference case for the DF computations. Additionally, experimental results from a single-cylinder laboratory engine are provided to discuss the ignition characteristics in the context of a real application. The main results of the present study are: (1) reducing tinj introduces excessive dilution of the DF mixture, (2) dilution lowers the reactivity of the DF mixture, leading to delayed high-temperature ignition and slow overall methane consumption, (3) low enough pilot quantity (tinj < 0.3 ms) may lead to very long ignition delay times, (4) cumulative heat release is dominated by low/high-temperature chemistry at low/high tinj values, (5) analysis of the underlying chemistry manifold implies that the sensitivity of ignition chemistry on mixing is time-dependent and connected to the end of injection time, and 6) long ignition delay times at very low tinj values can be decreased by decreasing injection pressure.  </p>

		  <p>Computational load imbalance due to direct integration of chemical kinetics is a well-known performance issue in parallel reacting flow simulations. We introduce an open-source dynamic load balancing model to address this problem within OpenFOAM, an open-source C++ library for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Due to the commonly applied operator splitting practice in reactive flow solvers, chemistry can be treated as an independent stiff ordinary differential equation (ODE) system within each computational cell. As a result of highly non-linear characteristics of chemical kinetics, a large variation in convergence rates of ODE integrator may occur, leading to a high load imbalance across multiprocessor configurations. However, the independent nature of chemistry ODE systems leads to a problem that can be parallelized easily (also termed embarrassingly parallel in the literature) during the flow solution. The presented model takes advantage of this feature and balances the chemistry load across available resources. When the load balancing is utilized together with a reference mapping model also introduced in this paper, a speed-up by a factor of 10 is reported for practical reactive flow simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this model is the first open-source implementation of chemistry load balancing in the literature.

		  <p>Here, a large-eddy simulation and finite-rate chemistry solver (see Kahila et al. Combustion and Flame, 2019) is utilized to investigate diesel spray assisted ignition of a lean methane-air mixture. A compression heating model is utilized to emulate ambient temperature and pressure increase in the envisioned compression ignition (CI) system. The key parameter is the start of injection (SOI) relative to a virtual top dead center (TDC), where the peak adiabatic compression pressure/temperature would be achieved. Altogether five different cases are investigated by advancing the SOI further away from the TDC with constant injection duration. The main findings of the paper are as follows: 1) Advancing the SOI advances the ignition timing of the spray with respect to the TDC from 0.91 to 7.08 CAD. However beyond a critical point the ignition time starts retarding towards the TDC to 4.46 CAD due to the excessively diluted diesel spray. 2) Advancing the SOI increases the contribution of leaner mixtures to heat release rate (HRR). Consequently, the low-temperature combustion HRR mode becomes more pronounced (from 33.9\% to 76.7\%) while the total HRR is reduced by a factor of 4. 3) Ignition is observed for all the investigated SOIs. However, the numerical findings indicate that advancing the SOI decreases the ignition kernel size, resulting in weaker ignition. 4) An ignition index analysis with frozen flow assumption indicates that for the SOIs close to the TDC the HRR mode appears as spray mixing controlled, while for advanced SOI it becomes reactivity controlled, dominated by fuel stratification.
