This thesis presents unsteady RANS simulations of an internal combustion engine under motored conditions using OpenFOAM. The TCC-III engine running at 800 rpm was chosen due to its simple design and available experimental data. Meshing was performed with both commercial (GridPro) and open-source (snappyHexMesh) tools, and engine motion was modeled using Wärtsilä’s in-house mesh mover. Simulation results were compared with ensemble-averaged PIV data. GridPro meshes provided faster and more accurate results due to higher-quality, block-structured, body-conformed meshing. The study establishes a validated CFD setup for further benchmarking of numerical methods and models for IC engines in OpenFOAM.
