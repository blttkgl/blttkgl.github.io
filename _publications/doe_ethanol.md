The study investigates optimal piston bowl geometries for a multi-cylinder ethanol-fueled engine using CFD and DoE. A Bayesian optimization step further improved thermal efficiency with fewer simulation runs. The results highlight the impact of piston geometry on combustion efficiency, mixing, and in-cylinder temperature distributions.
