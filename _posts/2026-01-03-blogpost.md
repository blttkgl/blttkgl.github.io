My resolution for 2026 was to finally start a blog, so here is my attempt to make that happen.

My name is **Bulut Tekgül**, and I currently work as a **Combustion & CFD Expert at Wärtsilä Finland**, a leading company in the marine and energy sectors. My day-to-day work revolves around understanding, modeling, and improving complex combustion systems, often under very real industrial constraints.

I hold a **PhD from Aalto University**, where my academic background was firmly rooted in **computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and combustion modeling**. My doctoral research focused on **high-fidelity simulations of reactive flows**, with particular emphasis on **internal combustion engines, spray combustion, and detailed chemical kinetics**. During this time, I spent a lot of effort developing, configuring, and validating CFD workflows in **OpenFOAM**, working with moving meshes, multiphase flows, and reactive simulations.

After my PhD, I continued in academia as a **postdoctoral researcher at Argonne National Laboratory** in the United States. There, I worked in a high-performance computing environment on advanced combustion and CFD problems, further deepening my experience with large-scale simulations, model validation, and the gap between fundamental research and practical engineering applications.

Before my current role, I worked across both **academic and applied research environments**, contributing to engine-related CFD projects that combined numerical methods, physical modeling, and experimental comparison. Over time, my work has increasingly lived at the intersection of **theory, simulation, and engineering reality** — where models have to be accurate, robust, and usable.

## Why this blog?

The idea behind this blog is simple:

- to share insights from my work in **combustion and CFD**
- to write practical posts about **OpenFOAM**, including workflows, pitfalls, and useful hacks
- to document things I wish I had written down years ago
- and occasionally to reflect on **engineering, research, and careers in technical fields**

This won’t be a textbook, and it won’t be marketing suggesting that everything works perfectly. It’s more of a **working engineer’s notebook**, cleaned up enough to be useful to others.

If you’re working with **OpenFOAM**, engine simulations, combustion modeling, or just enjoy thinking about how complex simulations meet real-world constraints, you’ll probably find something familiar here.

Thanks for reading and welcome!
